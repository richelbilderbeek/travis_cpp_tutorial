## Continuous integration

Collaboration can be scary: the other(s)1 may break the project worked on. The project can be of any type, not only programming, but also collaborative writing.

A good first step ensuring a pleasant experience is to use a version control system. A version control system keeps track of the changes in the project and allows for looking back in the project history when something has been broken.

The next step is to use an online version control repository, which makes the code easily accessible for all contributors. The online version control repository may also other additional collaborative tools, like a place where to submit bug reports, define project milestones and allowing external people to submit requests, bug reports or patches.

Up until here, it is possible to submit a change that breaks the build.

A continuous integration tools checks what is submitted to the project and possibly rejects it when it does not satisfy the tests and/or requirements of the project. Instead of manually proofreading and/or testing the submission and mailing the contributor his/her addition is rejected is cumbersome at least. A continuous integration tool will do this for you.

Now, if someone changes you project, you can rest assured that his/her submission does not break the project. Enjoy!

## Tutorial style

This tutorial is aimed at the beginner.

**Introduction of new terms and tools** All terms and tools are introduced briefly once, by a 'What is' paragraph. This allows a beginner to have a general idea about what the term/tool is, without going in-depth. Also, this allows for those more knowledgeable to skim the paragraph.

**Repetitiveness** To allow skimming, most chapters follow the same structure. Sometimes the exact same wording is used. This is counteracted by referring to earlier chapters.

**From Travis to source** This tutorial takes you from the broad concepts to the fine detail. I start with: 'What do I have to do?'. Every build focuses on how to build a project using the Travis continuous integration service. Usually Travis CI has to call at least one build script which is described and then the build files are described. Those build files usually invoke Qt Creator project files, which in turn combine source files to executables. I think this approach builds a better understanding of the process.

## This tutorial

This tutorial is available online at https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/travis_cpp_tutorial . Of course, it is checked by Travis that:

- all the setups described work
- this document can be converted to PDF. For this, it needs the files from all of these setups

## Acknowledgments

These people contributed to this tutorial:

- Kevin Ushey, for getting Rcpp11 and C++11 to work
- flywire, for editing and testing

## Collaboration

I welcome collaboration for this tutorial, especially in getting the scripts as clean as possible. If you want to help scraping off some lines, I will be happy to make you a collaborator of some GitHubs.

## Feedback

This tutorial is not intended to be perfect yet. For that, I need help and feedback from the community. All referenced feedback is welcome, as well as any constructive feedback

# Setting up the basic build

The basic build is more than just a collection of files. It needs to be set up.

This chapter shows how to:

- Create a GitHub online
- Bring the git repository to your local computer
- Create a Qt Creator project
- Create the build bash scripts

## Create a GitHub online

**What is GitHub?** GitHub is a site that creates websites around projects. It is said to host these projects. Each project contains at least one, but usually multiple files. These files can be put on your own hard disc, USB stick, or other storage devices. They could also be put at a central place, which is called a repository, so potentially others can also access these. GitHub is such a file repository. GitHub also keeps track of the history of the project, which is also called version control. GitHub uses git as a version control software. In short: GitHub hosts git repositories.

![Alt text](/images/GitHubHomepage.png){:style="width:700px"}

Figure 3 shows the GitHub homepage, https://github.com.

**Register** Before you can create a new repository, you must register. Registration is free for open source projects, with an unlimited2 amount of public repositories.

From the GitHub homepage, https://github.com (see Figure 3), click the top right button labeled 'Sign up'. This will take you to the 'Join GitHub' page (see Figure 4).

[![Alt text](/images/GitHubJoin.png "GitHub"){:style="width:700px"}](https://github.com)

Figure 4: The join GitHub page

Filling this in should be as easy. After Filling this in, you are taken to your GitHub profile page (Figure 5).

![Alt text](/images/GitHubProfile.png){:style="width:700px"}

Figure 5: A GitHub profile page

**Creating a repository** From your GitHub profile page (Figure 5), click on the plus ('Create new ...') at the top right, then click 'New repository' (Figure 6).

![Alt text](/images/GitHubCreateRepository.png){:style="width:700px"}

Figure 6: Create a GitHub repository

Do check 'Initialize this repository with a README', add a .gitignore with 'C++' and add a licence like 'GPL 3.0'.

![Alt text](/images/GitHubCreateRepository.png){:style="width:700px"}

Figure 7: Created a GitHub repository

You have now created your own online version controlled repository (Figure 7)!

blockdiag {
    A [shape = flowchart.terminator,  label = "main.cpp", numbered = v1];
    B [shape = flowchart.terminator,  label = "main.cpp", numbered = v2];
    C [shape = flowchart.terminator,  label = "main.cpp", numbered = v3];
    A -> B -> C;
}

Figure 8: Multiple versions of main.cpp. git allows to always go back to each version of main

## Bring the git repository to your local computer

**What is git?** git is a version control system. It allows you keep a history of a file its content in time. It is the more convenient alternative of making copies before each modification.

[![git-logo](/images/Git-Logo-2Color.png "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system"){: style="width:200px"}](https://git-scm.com/)

Figure 9: git logo

**Using git** Go to the terminal and type the following line to download your repository:

`git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository]`

Replace '[username]' and '[repository]' with your GitHub username and the repository name. A new folder called '[repository]' is created where you should work in. For example, to download this tutorial its repository to a folder called 'travis_cpp_tutorial':

`git clone https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/travis_cpp_tutorial`

## Create a Qt Creator project

Here we finally start working in C++, now that the version control has been discussed. This tutorial uses C++, mostly using the Qt Creator IDE (section 2.3) and the qmake (section 2.3) build system. Examples of using other IDEs or build systems can be found online, but are not covered in this tutorial.

**What is Qt Creator?** Qt Creator is a C++ IDE. An IDE (short for 'Intrated Development Environment') is the program in which you program. Other popular C++ IDE's are CLion, Code::Blocks, NetBeans, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. Qt Creator works on the three major platforms (Linux, Mac and Windows) and it is free to use for open source development. It uses both the qmake (see paragraph 2.3) and CMake build systems.

**Install IDE** Click the Qt creator logo and go through to download Qt for open source development then install it.

Figure 10: Qt creator logo

**Creating a new project** Here we create a C++ console application in Qt Creator. Upon loading Qt Creator, the 'Welcome' screen is shows (see figure 11). Here we select 'Create new project' to create a new project.

![Alt text](/images/QtCreatorWelcome.png){:style="width:700px"}

Figure 11: Qt Creator Welcome screen

In the 'Create new project' dialog (figure 12), we pick a C++ console application. There are plenty of other options, but here we choose to show a minimal example.

![Alt text](/images/QtCreatorNewProject.png){:style="width:400px"}

Figure 12: Qt Creator 'New Project' dialog

In the dialogs that follow, there is a 'Define build system' dialog (figure 13) in which we pick qmake (more about qmake in section 2.3). The other build system is CMake. This tutorial does not show CMake examples, but there are some online examples in which CMake is used.

![Alt text](/images/QtCreatorSelectBuildSystem.png){:style="width:400px"}

Figure 13: Qt Creator 'Define Build System' dialog

After some more dialogs, Qt Creator creates a 'Hello world' program for us, as shown in figure 14. In that same picture, at the top-left, we can see a file named 'untitled.pro', which is our Qt Creator project file.

![Alt text](/images/QtCreatorHelloWorld.png){:style="width:700px"}

Figure 14: Qt Creator 'Hello world' code. At the left one can see the 'untitled.pro' Qt Creator project file

**What is a Qt Creator project file?** A Qt Creator project file contains the information how a Qt Creator project must be built. It commonly has the .pro file extension.

    G -> D [label = "linker"];
    // simple graph
    A -> B -> C -> D;
    E -> F -> G -> D;
}

**What is g++?** g++ is the C++ compiler that is part of the GCC.

**What is C++98?** C++98 is the first C++ standard in 1998.

**What is the STL?** The STL, the Standard Template Library, is the C++ standard library.

## Create the build bash scripts

**What is bash?** 'bash' is a shell scripting language

# The basic build

This basic build consists of a 'Hello World' program, written in C++98. It uses the Qt Creator default settings: Qt Creator will create a Qt Creator project file, which in turn will use GCC.

- What is a C++98 'Hello world' program? See chapter 3.1
- The Travis build file. See chapter 3.2
- The build script. See chapter ??
- The Qt Creator project file. See chapter 3.3
- The source file. See chapter 3.4

## What is a C++98 'Hello world' program?

A 'Hello World' program shows the text 'Hello world' on the screen. It is a minimal program. Its purpose is to show that all machinery is in place to create an executable from C++ source code.

A listing of a 'Hello world' program is shown at Algorithm 3. Here I go through each line:

* `#include <iostream>`

Read a header file called 'iostream'

* `int main( ) { /* your code */ }`

The 'main' function is the starting point of a C++ program. Its body is between curly braces

* `std::cout << "Hello world\n" ;`

Show the text 'Hello world' on screen and go to the next line

## The Travis file

Travis CI is set up by a file called '.travis.yml'. The filename starts with a dot, which means it is a hidden file on UNIX systems. The extension 'yml' is an abbreviation of 'Yet another Markup Language'.

The '.travis.yml' file to build and run a 'Hello world' program looks like this:

Algorithm 1 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98\.travis.yml"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This .travis.yml file has the following elements:

- `language: cpp`

The main programming language of this project is C++

- `dist: xenial`

!!! Fail "Line not documented"

- `compiler: gcc`

The C++ code will be compiled by the GCC (What is GCC? See chapter 2.3)
```
- script:
  ‚àí qmake
  ‚àí make
  ‚àí ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98
```

The script that Travis will run.

- `qmake`

'qmake' is called to create a makefile (What is 'qmake'? See chapter 2.3) from the only Qt Creator project file. In this build, the name of this project file is omitted, as there is only one, but there are chapters in this tutorial where the project name is mentioned explicitly. Note that currently, qmake uses Qt4 (What is Qt4? see chapter 4.11.1)

- `make`

'make' is called to compile the makefile (What is 'make'? See chapter 2.3). In this build, 'make' is called without any arguments, but there are chapters in this tutorial where 'make' is called with arguments

- `./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98`

Run the created executable called 'travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98'

This Travis script can fail in in multiple places:

1. If the Qt Creator project file is incorrectly formed, 'qmake' will fail, and as it cannot create a valid makefile
2. If the Qt Creator project file is incomplete (for example: by omitting libraries), 'make' will fail. 'qmake' has created a makefile, after which 'make' finds out that it cannot create an executable with that makefile
3. The executable can return an error code. A 'Hello World' program is intended to return the error code for 'everything went fine'. Other programs
in this tutorial return error codes depending on test cases. It may also
be that dynamically linked libraries cannot be found, which crashes the
program at startup

## Qt Creator project

The following Qt Creator project file is used in this 'Hello world' build:

Algorithm 2 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This Qt Creator project file has the following elements:

- `SOURCES += main . cpp`

The file 'main.cpp' is a source file, that has to be compiled

- `QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += ‚àíWall ‚àíWextra ‚àíWe f fc++ ‚àíWerror`

The project is checked with all warnings ('-Wall'), with extra warnings ('-
Wextra') and with the Effective C++ [1] advices ('-Weffc++') enforced.
A warning is treated as an error ('-Werror'). This forces you (and your
collaborators) to write tidy code.

## C++ source file

The single C++ source file used in this 'Hello world' build is:

Algorithm 3 main.cpp
``` c++
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
All the code does is display the text 'Hello world', which is a traditional start for many programming languages. See 3.1 for a line-by-line explanation. The code is written in C++98 (What is C++98? See chapter 2.3). It does not use features from the newer C++ standards, but can be compiled under these newer standards. It will not compile under plain C.

# Extending the build by one step

The following chapter describe how to extend the build in one direction. These are:

- Use a debug and release build: see chapter 4.1
- Use of C++11: see chapter 4.2
- Use of C++14: see chapter 4.3
- Use of Boost: see chapter 4.4
- Use of Boost.Test: see chapter 4.5
- Use of clang: see chapter 4.6
- Use of gcov and Codecov: see chapter 4.7
- Use of gprof: see chapter 4.9
- Use of Qt: see chapter 4.10
- Use of Qt4: see chapter 4.10
- Use of Qt5: see chapter 4.10
- Use of QTest: see chapter 4.13
- Use of Rcpp: see chapter 4.14
- Use of SFML: see chapter 4.15
- Use of Urho3D: see chapter 4.17
- Use of Wt: see chapter 4.18

## Use of debug and release build

This example shows how to use Travis to create a debug and release build.

### What are debug and release builds?

A debug build means that the executable is created in such a way that helps in debugging it. For example, assert statements are only present in debug builds.

A release build means that the executable is created in a way that allows it to run quicker and have a smaller file size. For example, assert statements are removed from the source code in a release build.

### The Travis file

The Travis file has to do more things now, as it has to to create and run two different builds.

Here is how that looks like:

Algorithm 4 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_and_release\.travis.yml"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This .travis.yml file is rather self-explanatory: it builds a debug version, and runs it. After cleaning up, it builds a release version and runs it.

### The build bash scripts

Both build modes have their own build script. They are very similar to the one described in chapter ??:

Algorithm 5 build_debug.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_and_release\build_debug.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)

Algorithm 6 build_release.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_and_release\build_release.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The only difference is the added extra parameter to 'make', which is 'debug' for the debug build, and 'release' for the release build.

### The Qt Creator project file

The Qt Creator project file has to allow for the two different builds. It does so
as follows:

Algorithm 7 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_and_release.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_and_release\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_and_release.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Next to setting 'main.cpp' as the only source file, these lines are new:
‚Ä¢ CONFIG += console debug_and_release
Create a debug and release makefiles
‚Ä¢ CONFIG( release , debug | release ) {
DEFINES += NDEBUG
}

In the release makefile only, the preprocessor symbol 'NDEBUG' is #defined. This, among others, will remove all assert statements

### The source files

This build uses a 'Hello world'-like program that shows and proves the mode in which it is built:

Algorithm 8 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_and_release\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
It will show in text the build type. Next to this, an assert is called. In release mode, the known-to-be-false assert statement is removed. In debug mode, the known-to-be-true assert statement is left in.

## Use of C++11

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by using C++11, instead of C++98.

### What is C++11?

C++11 is the C++ standard formalized in 2011. Its working title was C++0x, as then it was assumed that the standard would be finished in 200x. C++11 is fully backwards compatible with C++98. One of the major new features of C++11 is the introduction of move semantics, which results in faster run-time code, by possibly reducing needless copies of objects.

In my examples, I typically use the C++11 'noexcept' keyword (What is noexcept? See chapter 4.2.2).

### What is noexcept?

'noexcept' is a C++11 keyword. It is a modifier that specifies that a (member) function will not throw an exception. Would that function throw an exception anyhow, the program is terminated.

### The Travis file

The default Travis CI setup is not sufficient to use C++11 (yet). Travis CI by default uses a LTS ('Long Term Stable') repository, as these is the most stable and reliable. The version of g++ in that repository is version 4.6.3, which does not support C++11. To use C++11, we will ?rst add a fresher (less stable) repository. Then we can install g++-5,that does support C++11.

Here is how that looks like:

Algorithm 9 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11\.travis.yml"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This .travis.yml file has some new features:

‚Ä¢ sudo : require
For this build, we need super user rights. When you need super user rights, the build will be slower.
‚Ä¢ before_install :
The following events will take place before installation
‚Ä¢ sudo add‚àíapt‚àírepository ‚àí‚àíyes ppa : ubuntu‚àítoolchain‚àír/ test
A new apt repository is added. The '?yes' explicitly states that we are
sure we want to do this. Without the '?yes' ?ag, Travis will be prompted
if it is sure it wants to add this repository. This would break the build.
‚Ä¢ sudo apt‚àíget update ‚àíqq
After adding the new apt repository, then the current repositories need to
be updated updated. The '-qq' means that this happens quietly; with the
least amount of output.
‚Ä¢ install : sudo apt‚àíget install ‚àíqq g++‚àí5
Install g++-5, which is a newer version of GCC than is installed by default

In the script, the code is built and then run.

### The Qt Creator project file

The Qt Creator project file by default calls 'g++' with its default C++ standard.

In this build, we will have to let it call g++-5 with the C++11 standard:

Algorithm 10 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11.pro"
```
```
# Project files
SOURCES += main.cpp
# Compile with high warning levels, a warning is an error
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -Weffc++ -Werror
# C++11
CONFIG += c++11
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++11
```

The Qt Creator project file has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3, except for:
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_CXX = g++‚àí5
Set the C++ compiler to use g++ version 5, which is a newer version than
currently used by default
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_LINK = g++‚àí5
Set the C++ linker to use g++ version 5, which is a newer version than
currently used by default
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_CC = g++5
Set the C compiler to use g++ version 5, which is a newer version than
currently used by default
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += ‚àístd=c++11
Compile under C++11

Except for this, all is just the same.

### The source files

This build uses a 'Hello world'-like program that uses C++11:

Algorithm 11 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
It will show the text 'Hello world' on screen.

The keyword 'noexcept' (What is noexcept? See chapter 4.2.2) does not exist in C++98 and it will fail to compile. This code will compile under newer versions of C++.

## Use of C++14

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by using C++14. What is C++14? C++14 is a C++ standard that was formalized in 2014. It is fully backwards compatible with C++11 and C++98. It does not have any major new features, and mostly extends C++11 features.

In my examples, I usually add digit separators: instead of '1000', in C++14 one can write '1'000', using a single quote as a separator. This will not compile in C++11.

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 12 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14\.travis.yml"
```
```
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
dist: trusty
before_install:
# C++14
- sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
- sudo apt-get update -qq
install:
# C++14
- sudo apt-get install -qq g++-5
- sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-5 90
script:
- qmake
- make
- ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14
```

This .travis.yml file is the same as the C++11 build in chapter 4.2.

### The Qt Creator project files

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 13 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14.pro"
```
```
SOURCES += main.cpp
# Compile with high warning levels, a warning is an error
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -Weffc++ -Werror
# C++14
CONFIG += c++14
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++14
```
The Qt Creator project file has the same lines as the C++11 build in chapter 4.2, except for that it uses one different QMAKE_CXXFLAGS item:
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += ‚àístd=c++14
Compile under C++14

### The source files

The single C++ source file used is:

Algorithm 14 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This is a simple C++14 program that will not compile under C++11.

## Adding Boost

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by also using the Boost libraries.

### What is Boost?

Boost is a collection of C++ libraries.

[![Boost_logo](/images/Boost_logo.png "boost - C++ source libraries"){: style="width:200px"}](https://www.boost.org/)

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 15 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_boost\.travis.yml"
```
```
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
addons:
apt:
packages: libboost-all-dev
script:
- ./build.sh
- ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_boost
```

This .travis.yml file has one new feature:

‚Ä¢ addons :
apt :
packages : libboost‚àíall ‚àídev
This makes Travis aware that you want to use the aptitude package 'libboost-all-dev'. Note that this code cannot be put on one line: it has to be indented similar to this

Using packages like this avoids using sudo, which speeds up the build. Not all packages can be used as such, however, but most are.

### The build bash scripts

The bash build script to build and run this:

Algorithm 16 build.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_boost\build.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The bash script is identical to the basic build script as in chapter ??.

### The Qt Creator project files

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 17 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_boost.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_boost\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_boost.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The Qt Creator project file has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.3.

### The source files

The single C++ source file used is:

Algorithm 18 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_boost\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
All the file does is display the version of Boost on the screens. It will only compile when the Boost libraries are present. Currently, on Travis CI, the default Boost version is 1.46.1.

## Adding Boost.Test

Adding only a testing framework does not work: it will not compile in C++98. Instead, this is covered in chapter 5.4.

## Use of clang

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is compiled by the clang compiler.

### What is Clang?

clang is a C++ compiler

[![LLVM_Logo](/images/LLVM_Logo.svg "Clang - a C language family frontend for LLVM"){: style="height:150px"}](https://clang.llvm.org/)

Figure 17: clang logo

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 19 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_clang_cpp98\.travis.yml"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This .travis.yml file uses the package clang (without needing sudo), compiles the program and then runs it.

### The build bash scrip

The bash build script to build this:

Algorithm 20 build.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_clang_cpp98\build.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The bash script is identical to the basic bash script as described in chapter ??.

### The Qt Creator project files

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 21 travis_qmake_clang_cpp98.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_clang_cpp98\travis_qmake_clang_cpp98.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The Qt Creator project file.. except for:
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_CXX = clang++
Set the C++ compiler to use clang++
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_LINK = clang++
Set the C++ linker to use clang++
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_CC = clang
Set the C compiler to use clang

### The source files

The single C++ source file used is:

Algorithm 22 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_clang_cpp98\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This is just a 'Hello world' program, as discussed in detail in chapter .

## Adding gcov and Codecov

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by calling gcov and
using codecov to show the code coverage.

### What is gcov?

gcov is a tool that works with GCC to analyse code coverage

### What is Codecov?

Codecov works nice with GitHub and give nicer reports

[![Codecov](/images/Codecov.png "GCC - the GNU Compiler Collection"){: style="height:150px"}](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Figure 18: Codecov logo

Here is an example of a code coverage report, which is generated by this
example:

![Codecov_report](../travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_gcov/travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_gcov_codecov.png "Codecov report for this build")

Figure 19: Codecov report of this build

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 23 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_gcov\.travis.yml"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This .travis.yml file has some new features:

‚Ä¢ sudo : require
Travis will give super user rights to the script. This will slow the build
time, but it is inevitable for the next step
‚Ä¢ before_install : sudo pip install codecov
Travis will use pip to install codecov using super user rights. It is tempo-
rary workaround to use sudo, as sudo should not be needed. This is seen
as a bug, is known and solved. It just has to seep through to the Travis
CI GNU/Linux distro.
‚Ä¢ after_success : codecov
After the script has run successfully, codecov is called

The code coverage performed in this build mismatches with the goals of code coverage. One of these goals is to test for unused ('dead') code. Code coverage fits better within a debug build, where all functions are tested with valid and invalid input. Chapter 6.1 shows a build in which code coverage is tested in debug mode only.

### The build bash scripts

The bash build to measure the code coverage:

Algorithm 24 get_code_cov
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_gcov\get_code_cov"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This script uses gcov on all implementation files.
Going into a bit more detail on the new lines:
‚Ä¢ for filename in ` find . | egrep '\.cpp ' `;
do
gcov ‚àín ‚àío . $filename > /dev/null ;
done
Find all filenames (in this folder and its subfolder) that end with '.cpp'. For each of these filenames, let 'gcov' work on it. The '-n' ?ag denotes 'no output please'. Because there is still some output, this output is sent to the void of '/dev/null'. The '-o .' means that the object files are in the same folder as this script

### The Qt Creator project files

This normal is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 25 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_gcov.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_gcov\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_gcov.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The Qt Creator project file has two new lines:
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += ‚àífprofile ‚àíarcs ‚àíftest ‚àícoverage
Let the C++ compiler add coverage information
‚Ä¢ LIBS += ‚àílgcov
Link against the gcov library

### The source files

The C++ source file used by the normal build is:

Algorithm 26 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_gcov\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
It defines a function called 'do_magic'. It is called for the value two, but not for the value 42. Due to this, we expect to see an incomplete code coverage. And this is indeed detected, as shown in Figure 19.

## Adding OCLint

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by adding OCLint
support. Because we intendedly use smelly code, this build is supposed to fail
due to (only) this.

What is OCLint? OCLint is a static code analysis tool.

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 27 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_oclint\.travis.yml"
```
```
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
sudo: required
install:
- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test --yes
- sudo apt-get update -qq
- sudo apt-get install -qq libstdc++6-4.7-dev
- ./install_oclint.sh
script:
- ./build.sh
- ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_oclint
- ./do_oclint.sh
```

This .travis.yml file has one new feature:
‚Ä¢ sudo add‚àíapt‚àírepository ppa : ubuntu‚àítoolchain‚àír/ test ‚àí‚àíyes
Add a newer apt repository than installed on Travis
‚Ä¢ sudo apt‚àíget update ‚àíqq
Update the packages
‚Ä¢ sudo apt‚àíget install ‚àíqq libstdc++6‚àí4.7‚àídev
This makes Travis install the package 'libstdc++6-4.7-dev', that is needed
by OCLint
‚Ä¢ ./ install_oclint . sh
This makes Travis install OCLint
‚Ä¢ ./ do_oclint . sh
Let OCLint check the code
‚Ä¢ cat log_correct . txt
Let Travis show the log of a file that passes OCLint
‚Ä¢ cat log_correct . txt
Let Travis show the log of a file that does not pass OCLint

### The build bash scripts

The bash build script to build this:

Algorithm 28 build.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_oclint\build.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The bash script has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.

The script to let OCLint check the code:

Algorithm 29 do_oclint.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_oclint\do_oclint.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Here I call OCLint with these parameters:
‚Ä¢ ‚àío oclint . log
Write the output to the file 'oclint.log'
‚Ä¢ main . cpp
All the files to be analysed
‚Ä¢ ‚àí‚àí
After this are the compiler settings
‚Ä¢ ‚àíc
?no idea, please email me if you do

Additionally, I analyse the log files using success=`egrep "FilesWithViolations=0 P1=0 P2=0 P3=0" log_correct . txt | wc ‚àíl `

In more detail, this means:
‚Ä¢ success = `[...] `
The variable 'success' get assigned the outcome of the part between back-
ticks
‚Ä¢ egrep "[ regex ]" oclint . log
Search through the file 'oclint.log' for the regular expression '[regex]'
‚Ä¢ | wc ‚àíl
The result of the egrep is piped to a word count ('wc') by line '-l'. If egrep
found the regex, the line count will be 1, yet 0 otherwise

### The Qt Creator project files

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 30 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_oclint.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_oclint\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_oclint.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The Qt Creator project file has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.

### The source files

The C++ source file used is just a 'Hello World' program:

Algorithm 31 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_oclint\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)

## Adding profiling

## Adding the Qt library

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by also using the Qt library.

What is Qt? Qt (pronounce 'cute') is a library to create C++ GUI's.

[![Qt_logo_2015](/images/Qt_logo_2015.svg "GCC - the GNU Compiler Collection"){: style="height:150px"}](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Figure 20: Qt logo

At this moment, there are two versions of Qt: Qt4 and Qt5. The GNU/Linux version Travis CI uses has Qt4. When this GNU/Linux distro changes, Qt5 will be the new (next) default.

## Adding the Qt4 library

### What is Qt4?

Qt4 is version 4 of the Qt library (What is Qt? see chapter 4.10).

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 32 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4\.travis.yml"
```
```
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
# Start virtual X server, from https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/
before_script:
- "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
- "sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start"
- sleep 3 # give xvfb some time to start
script:
- ./build.sh
- ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4
```

This .travis.yml file starts xvfb before the script. In the script, it builds the code first, before running the resulting executable. Instead of calling 'qmake', however, it explicitly calls 'qmake-qt4'.

### What is xvfb?

xvfb is the vitual X server.

### The Qt Creator project files

This project is compiled from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 33 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4.pro"
```
```
QT += core gui
# Cannot use -Weffc++ with Qt4
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Werror
SOURCES += main.cpp
SOURCES += my_dialog.cpp
FORMS += my_dialog.ui
HEADERS += my_dialog.h
RESOURCES += travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4.qrc
```

The Qt Creator project file:

‚Ä¢ QT += core gui
To be able to use a GUI, one needs to add 'gui' (and keep 'core') defined
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += ‚àíWall ‚àíWextra ‚àíWerror
When working with a Qt resource file, the '-We?c++' ?ag will trigger a
warning
‚Ä¢ SOURCES += main . cpp
HEADERS += my_dialog .h
SOURCES += my_dialog . cpp
FORMS += my_dialog . ui
The files that, respectively, contain the main function de?nition, the dec-
laration of 'my_dialog', the implementation of 'my_dialog' and the form
of 'my_dialog'
‚Ä¢ RESOURCES += travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4 . qrc
Use a resource file. This resource file contains the picture that is on the
form.

### The source files

This project uses multiple source files. The main function is defined as such:

Algorithm 34 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This is a standard implementation of the main function for a graphical Qt application.
qwfq
‚Ä¢ #include <QApplication>
‚Ä¢ #include "my_dialog .h"
Read the headers of, respectively, the Qt QApplication class and our custom my_dialog class
‚Ä¢ int main( int argc , char ‚àóargv [ ] )
This is one of the two official versions of main. This version takes into account the arguments supplied at startup of the application. For example, would this application be called with 'travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4 hello', the value of argc ('argument count') would be two and the array argv would be (thus) of size two with strings 'travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4' and 'hello'
‚Ä¢ QApplication a(argc , argv );
Start the QApplication class
‚Ä¢ my_dialog d;
d. show ();
Create an instance of my_dialog and show it
‚Ä¢ return a . exec ();
Start QApplication (which handles events for my_dialog) and return an error code depending on how the application is terminated.

The declaration of my_dialog looks like this:

Algorithm 35 my_dialog.h
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4\my_dialog.h"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This header file is completely generated by Qt Creator.
‚Ä¢ #ifndef MY_DIALOG_H
‚Ä¢ #define MY_DIALOG_H
//...
‚Ä¢ #endif // MY_DIALOG_H
This is an #include guard. An #include guard ensures that this file is read only once per compilation unit. Every header file should have these [REF], although '#pragma once' is also a fine solution.
‚Ä¢ #include <QDialog>
Read the Qt QDialog header file
‚Ä¢ namespace Ui {
class my_dialog ;
}

A forward-declaration of a class called 'my_dialog' within the 'Ui' namespace. Forward-declarations intend to speed up compilation.
‚Ä¢ class my_dialog : public QDialog
{
//...
};
Create a class called 'my_dialog' which is a derived class of the Qt 'QDialog' class
‚Ä¢ Q_OBJECT
Macro to signify that this class uses the Qt signal and slot mechanism
‚Ä¢ public :
explicit my_dialog(QWidget ‚àóparent = 0);
~my_dialog ();
Public constructor and destructor
‚Ä¢ private :
Ui : : my_dialog ‚àóui ;
The private user interface (which has only been forward-declared)

The implementation of my_dialog looks like this:

Algorithm 36 my_dialog.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt4\my_dialog.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Most of this code is generated by Qt, except for the addition of a timer that closes the dialog after one second:
‚Ä¢ #include "my_dialog .h"
‚Ä¢ #include "ui_my_dialog .h"
‚Ä¢ #include <QTimer>
Read, respectively, the declaration of my_dialog, the declaration of the user interface of my_dialog, and the declaration of the Qt QTimer class
‚Ä¢ my_dialog : : my_dialog(QWidget ‚àóparent ) :
QDialog( parent ) ,
ui (new Ui : : my_dialog)
{
//...
}
This is a standard constructor. The base class of my_dialog, QDialog, is called with the optional 'parent' argument. The user interface is instantiated.
‚Ä¢ ui‚àí>setupUi ( this );
Set up the user interface of my_dialog
‚Ä¢ QTimer ‚àó const timer (new QTimer( this ));
connect (timer ,SIGNAL( timeout ()) , this ,SLOT( close ()));
timer‚àí>setInterval (1000);
timer‚àí>start ();
Create a timer, which will be deleted by this class. Connect its 'timeout' signal to the 'close' slot of this dialog. Set the interval of the timer to a thousand milliseconds and start it.
‚Ä¢ my_dialog ::~ my_dialog ()
{
delete ui ;
}

A standard destructor, that deletes the user interface

## Adding the Qt5 library

### What is Qt5?

Qt5 is version 5 of the Qt library (What is Qt? see chapter 4.10).

### The Travis file

Qt5 is not the default Qt version in the current Travis CI GNU/Linux distro. Thanks to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25737062/travis-ci-for-a-qt5-project#25743300 for showing how install Qt5 on Travis CI:

Algorithm 37 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt5\.travis.yml"
```
```
sudo: required
dist: trusty
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
# From https://gist.github.com/jreese/6207161#gistcomment-1462109

before_script:
- "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
- "sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start"
- sleep 3 # give xvfb some time to start
script:
- ./build.sh
- ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt5
```

This .travis.yml file is an extension of when adding the Qt4 library (chapter 4.11). The new lines are:
‚Ä¢ sudo add‚àíapt‚àírepository ‚àí‚àíyes ppa : ubuntu‚àísdk‚àíteam/ppa
Add an apt repository that has Qt5
‚Ä¢ sudo apt‚àíget update ‚àíqq
Update the current apt repositories, to be able to ?nd Qt5
‚Ä¢ ‚àí sudo apt‚àíget install qtbase5‚àídev qtdeclarative5‚àídev
‚àí sudo apt‚àíget install libqt5webkit5‚àídev libsqlite3 ‚àídev
‚àí sudo apt‚àíget install qt5‚àídefault qttools5‚àídev‚àítools
Install all Qt5 apt packagess. I put these on three lines just for readability.

### The Qt Creator project files

This project compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 38 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt5.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt5\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt5.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The Qt Creator project file is similar to the one needed for the Qt4 library (chapter 4.11), except for:
‚Ä¢ QT += core gui widgets
Add 'core', 'gui' and (new) 'widgets' to the Qt configuration. One of the differences between Qt4 and Qt5 is that part of what was 'gui' has been moved to 'widgets'.

### The source files

This project uses multiple source files.

The main function is defined as such:

Algorithm 39 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt5\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This main function definition is close to identical to that of when using Qt4 (see chapter 4.11).
The declaration of my_qt5_dialog is as such:

Algorithm 40 my_qt5_dialog.h
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt5\my_qt5_dialog.h"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This header file is also close to identical to that of when using Qt4 (see chapter 4.11).

The implementation of my_qt5_dialog:

Algorithm 41 my_qt5_dialog.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt5\my_qt5_dialog.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This implementation file is also close to identical to that of when using Qt4 (see chapter 4.11), except for this line:
‚Ä¢ connect (
timer , &QTimer : : timeout ,
this , &my_qt5_dialog : : close
);
This is the Qt5 syntax of connecting QTimer its 'timeout' slot to my_qt5_dialog its 'close' slot. This syntax will not compile with Qt4. The new syntax has the benefit that during compilation it can be checked that the signals and slots exist (Qt4 emits a warning at runtime).

## Adding QTest

One cannot use QTest without Qt. Because this thus takes two steps, this is covered in chapter 5.2.

## Adding Rcpp

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by also using the Rcpp library/package.

What is R? R is a programming language.

[![Rlogo](/images/Rlogo.png "R - a free software environment for statistical computing"){: style="width:150px"}](https://www.r-project.org/)

Figure 21: R logo

What is Rcpp? Rcpp is a package that allows to call C++ code from R

### Build overview

The build will be complex I will show the C++ build and the R build separately:

C + +
```
main.cpp
domagic.pro
do_magic_cpp.h
do_magic_cpp.cpp
```
R
```
do_magic_r.R
test ‚àí do_magic.R
```

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 42 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_rcpp\.travis.yml"
```
```
sudo: true
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
before_install:
- sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:marutter/rrutter # For R
- sudo apt-get update -qq
install:
- sudo apt-get install -qq r-base r-base-dev # For R
- sudo apt-get install -qq lyx # For pdflatex
- sudo apt-get install -qq texlive # For pdflatex
script:
# C++
- ./build_cpp.sh
- ./domagic
# R wants all non-R files gone...
- ./clean.sh
- sudo Rscript install_r_packages.R
- rm .gitignore
- rm src/.gitignore
- rm .travis.yml
- rm -rf .git
- rm -rf ..Rcheck
# Now R is ready to go
- R CMD check .
after_failure:
# fatal error: Rcpp.h: No such file or directory
- find / -name 'Rcpp.h'
# R logs
- cat /home/travis/build/richelbilderbeek/travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_rcpp/..Rcheck/00install.out
```

This .travis.yml file is longer than usual, as it both compiles and runs the C++ and R code.

### The build bash scripts

The C++ build script:

Algorithm 43 build_cpp.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\build_cpp.sh"
```
```
#!/ bin/bash
qmake
make
```

The bash script has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.

This R build script installs the required R packages:

Algorithm 44 build_cpp.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\install_r_packages.R"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)

### The Qt Creator project files

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 45 domagic.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\domagic.pro"
```
```
TEMPLATE = app
CONFIG += console
CONFIG -= app_bundle
CONFIG -= qt
INCLUDEPATH += src
INCLUDEPATH += /home/p230198/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/Rcpp/include
INCLUDEPATH += /home/richel/R/i686-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/Rcpp/include
INCLUDEPATH += /usr/share/R/include/
SOURCES += \
src/do_magic_cpp.cpp \
main.cpp
HEADERS += \
src/do_magic_cpp.h
LIBS += -lR
```

The name of the Qt Creator project file is 'domagic' as it follows the same naming as the R project. It add the R and Rcpp and src folders to its include path and links to R.

### The C++ and R source files

Both C++ and R use this function. It is called 'do_magic_cpp'. It is declared in the header file 'do_magic_cpp.h', as shown here:

Algorithm 46 src/do_magic_cpp.h
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\src\do_magic_cpp.h"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The header file consists solely of #include guards and the declaration of the function 'do_magic_cpp'.

The function 'do_magic_cpp' is implemented in the implementation file 'do_magic_cpp.cpp', as shown here:

Algorithm 47 src/do_magic_cpp.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\src\do_magic_cpp.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This implementation file has gotten rather elaborate, thanks to Rcpp and documentation. This is because it has to be callable from both C++ and R and satisfy the requirement from both languages.

### The C++-only source files

The C++ program has a normal main function:

Algorithm 48 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
All it does is a simple test of the 'do_magic_cpp' function.

### The R-only source files

The R function 'do_magic_r' calls the C++ function 'do_magic_cpp':

Algorithm 49 R/do_magic_r.R
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\R\do_magic_r.R"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Next to this, it is just Roxygen2 documentation R allows for easy testing using the 'testthat' package. A test file looks as such:

Algorithm 50 tests/testthat/test-do_magic_r.R
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\tests\testthat\test-do_magic.R"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The tests call both the R and C++ functions with certain inputs and checks if the output matches the expectations.

## Adding the SFML library

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by also using the SFML library. The result will be a simple graphical display as shown in Figure 23:

![SFML_library](../travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_sfml/travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_sfml.png "")

Figure 23: travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_sfml screenshot

What is SFML? SFML ('Simple and Fast Multimedia Library') is a library intended for 2D game development.

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 51 .travis.yml

```
```

Add an apt repository for a fresh version of SFML
‚Ä¢ install : sudo apt‚àíget install libsfml ‚àídev
This makes Travis install the needed package

### The build bash scripts

The bash build script to build this:

Algorithm 52 build.sh
```

```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The bash script has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.

### The Qt Creator project files

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 53 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_sfml.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_sfml\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_sfml.pro"

Link to the SFML libraries

### The source files

The single C++ source file used is:

Algorithm 54 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_sfml\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
It draws a rotating rectangle by incrementing the variable 'angle'. After this variable reaches a certain value, the application is terminated. The reason the application is terminated, is because it must be run on Travis CI and thus terminate without user input.

## Adding SLOCcount

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by also measuring the SLOCcount.

What is SLOCcount? SLOCcount estimates the costs to develop code.

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 55 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_sloccount\.travis.yml"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This .travis.yml file has one new feature:

## Adding the Urho3D library

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by also using the Urho3D library.
What is Urho3D? Urho3D is a library to create C++ 3D games.

## Adding the Wt library

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by also using the Wt library.

What is Wt? Wt (pronounce 'witty') is a library to create C++ websites.

# Extending the build by two steps

You will probably want to combine the single ingredients in the previous chapters. This will also result in more complex project setups. In this chapter, such setups will be described:

‚Ä¢ Use of gcov in debug mode only: see chapter 5.1
‚Ä¢ Use of Qt and QTest: see chapter
‚Ä¢ Use of C++11 and Boost: see chapter 5.3
‚Ä¢ Use of C++11 and Boost.Test: see chapter 5.4
‚Ä¢ Use of C++14 and Boost: see chapter 5.12

## Use of gcov in debug mode only

In this example, the C++98 build with gcov (chapter 4.7) is extended by using gcov in debug mode only.

### Build overview

This will be a more complex build, consisting of two projects:

‚Ä¢ A release version that just runs the code, assuming it to be correct
‚Ä¢ A debug version that tests the code and measures code coverage

The filenames are shown in this Figure:

travis_qmake
_gcc_cpp11
_gcov.pro
main.cpp
do_magic.h
do_magic.cpp
travis_qmake
_gcc_cpp11
_gcov_gcov.pro
main_gcov.cpp

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 66 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_gcov\.travis.yml"
```
```
sudo: require
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
before_install: sudo pip install codecov
script:
- ./build_debug.sh
- ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_gcov_debug
- ./get_code_cov.sh
- codecov
- ./clean.sh
- ./build_release.sh
- ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_debug_gcov
```

This .travis.yml file has some new features:
‚Ä¢ sudo : true
Travis will give super user rights to the script. This will slow the build time, but it is inevitable for the next step
‚Ä¢ before_install : sudo pip install codecov
Travis will use pip to install codecov using super user rights
‚Ä¢ after_success : codecov
After the script has run successfully, codecov is called

### The build bash scripts

## Qt and QTest

This build is about a Qt dialog that displays an image (using a Qt resource).

When the key 'x' is pressed, it should close. The release build is just that application. The debug build tests if the application indeed closes upon a press of the 'x' key. Its primary output is test report. During the test, the dialog will show up shortly.

In this build, only one dialog is tested. For a build that has more dialogs,
see chapter .

### What is QTest?

QTest is the Qt testing framework

### Do not use Boost.Test to test graphical Qt aplications

The Boost.Test library (see chapter 5.4) works great with console (that is: non-graphical) applications. But is is tedious to let it test graphical Qt classes.

Why is this tedious? Because Qt has its own Qt way, that works best in that way. QTest will process the QApplication event queue and have many privileges. Using Boost.Test will make you responsible to do yourself what Qt normally does for you in the back, such as emptying the QApplication event queue. Next to this, you will have to make some member functions public (e.g. keyPressEvent) to allow your tests to use these.

### The Travis file

Algorithm 75 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\.travis.yml"
```
```
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
# Start virtual X server
before_script:
- "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
- "sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start"
- sleep 3 # give xvfb some time to start
script:
- ./build_test.sh
- ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest_test
- ./build_normal.sh
```

Because this application uses graphics, we need to start a virtual X server on Travis CI (see https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers), before the tests run.

In the script, the testing executable is created and run. The test results will be visible in Travis CI.

After the test, the normal executable is created. The normal executable is not run, as it requires user input. This means that on Travis CI, it would run forever, wouldn't Travis CI detect this and indicate a failure.

### The build bash scripts

There need to be two bash scripts, one for building the testing executable, one for building the normal program. Both are as short as can be:

Algorithm 76 build_test.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\build_test.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)

Algorithm 77 build_normal.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\build_normal.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)

### The Qt Creator project files

There need to be two Qt Creator scripts, one for building the testing executable, one for building the normal program. Both are as short as can be. The only difference is that the testing project file uses 'QT += testlib'.

Test:

Algorithm 78 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest_test.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest_test.pro"

```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)

### The source files

The dialog This is the source of dialog:

Algorithm 80 my_dialog.h
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\my_dialog.h"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The only added line, is the 'keyPressEvent'.

Algorithm 81 my_dialog.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\my_dialog.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Here we can see that when 'x' is pressed, the application will close. The main function of the normal executable Most graphical Qt applications have this main function:

Algorithm 82 qtmain.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\qtmain.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This main is given as default when creating a new graphical Qt application. The main function of the testing executable The QTest framework collects all tests and calls these within a QTest-generated main function. This leaves us little left to write (which is awesome):

Algorithm 83 qtmain_test.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\qtmain_test.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The class for the tests Here comes in the QTest architecture: for each test suite we will have to create a class:

Algorithm 84 my_dialog_test.h
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\my_dialog_test.h"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Here we create a class called 'my_dialog_test'. The ?t into the QTest framework each test suite
‚Ä¢ must be a derived class from QObject
‚Ä¢ the header file must include the 'QtTest' header file
where each member function is a tests.

The implementation of each test can be seen in the implementation file:

Algorithm 85 my_dialog_test.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp98_qt_qtest\my_dialog_test.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The 'QVERIFY' macro is used by the QTest framework to do a single check, which will end up in the test report. The QTest has some privileges, as it can directly click keys on the form, also when the 'keyPressEvent' isn't public.

## C++11 and Boost libraries

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by also using the Boost libraries.

The chapter has the following specs:
‚Ä¢ Build system: qmake
‚Ä¢ C++ compiler: gcc
‚Ä¢ C++ version: C++11
‚Ä¢ Libraries: STL and Boost
‚Ä¢ Code coverage: none
‚Ä¢ Source: one single file, main.cpp

The single C++ source file used is:

Algorithm 86 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost\main.cpp"
```
```
#include <boost/graph/adjacency_list .hpp>
int f () noexcept {
boost : : adjacency_list<> g ;
boost : : add_vertex(g) ;
return boost : : num_vertices(g) ;
}
int main() {
if ( f () != 1) return 1;
}
```

All the file does is to create an empty graph, from the Boost.Graph library. It will not compile without the Boost libraries absent.

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 87 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost.pro"
```
```
SOURCES += main.cpp
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -Werror
QMAKE_CXX = g++-5
QMAKE_LINK = g++-5
QMAKE_CC = gcc-5
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++11
```

The Qt Creator project file has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.

The bash build script to build and run this:

Algorithm 88 build.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost\build.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The bash script has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 89 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost\.travis.yml"
```
```
sudo: true
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
before_install:

- sudo apt-get update -qq
install: sudo apt-get install -qq g++-5
addons:
apt:
packages: libboost-all-dev
script: ./build.sh
```

This .travis.yml file has ...

## C++11 and Boost.Test

Boost.Test works great for console applications. If you use a GUI library like
Qt, using QTest is easier (see chapter 5.2)

This project consists out of two projects:
‚Ä¢ travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test.pro: the real code
‚Ä¢ travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test_test.pro: the tests

Both projects center around a function called 'add', which is located in the 'my_function.h' and 'my_function.cpp' files, as shown here:

```
travis_qmake
_gcc_cpp11
_boost_test.pro
main.cpp my_function.h
my_function.cpp
travis_qmake
_gcc_cpp11
_boost.pro
main_test.cpp
my_function_test.cpp
```

![Tag](image.png "Description"){: style="height=150px"}

Figure 30: Venn diagram of the files uses in this build

Both of these are compiled both in release and debug mode.

Specifics The basic build has the following specs:
‚Ä¢ Build system: qmake
‚Ä¢ C++ compiler: gcc
‚Ä¢ C++ version: C++11
‚Ä¢ Libraries: STL and Boost, demonstrating Boost.Test
‚Ä¢ Code coverage: none
‚Ä¢ Source: multiple files: main.cpp, my_function.h, my_function.cpp, test_my_function.cpp

### The function

First the function that is (1) tested by the test build (2) called by the real build, is shown here:

Algorithm 90 my_functions.h
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test\my_functions.h"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This header file has the #include guards and the declaration of the function 'add'. It takes two integer values as an argument and returns an int.

Its definition is shown here:

Algorithm 91 my_functions.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test\my_functions.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Perhaps it was expected that 'add' adds the two integers

## Test build

The test build' is the build that tests the function. It does not have a 'main.cpp' as the exe build has, but uses 'test_my_functions.cpp' as its main source file.

This can be seen in the Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 92 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test_test.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test_test.pro"

Note how this Qt Creator project file links to the Boost unit test framework.

Its main source file is shown here:

Algorithm 93 main_test.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test\main_test.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
It uses the Boost.Test framework to automatically generate a main function and test suite. An empty file is created, so Travis can verify there has been built both a debug and release mode.

Its main testing file file is shown here:

Algorithm 94 my_functions_test.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test\my_functions_test.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
It tests the function 'add'.

### Exe build

The 'exe' build' is the build that uses the function.

Algorithm 95 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Next to using the function 'add', also a file is created, so Travis can verify there has been built both a debug and release mode.

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 96 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Note how this Qt Creator project file does not link to the Boost unit test framework.

### Build script

The bash build script to build, test and run this:

Algorithm 97 build.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test\build.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
In this script both projects are compiled in both debug and release mode. All four executables are run.

### Travis script

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 98 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test\.travis.yml"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This .travis.yml file has ...

## C++11 and clang

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by using clang and C++11.

The chapter has the following specs:
‚Ä¢ Build system: qmake
‚Ä¢ C++ compiler: clang
‚Ä¢ C++ version: C++11
‚Ä¢ Libraries: STL only
‚Ä¢ Code coverage: none
‚Ä¢ Source: one single file, main.cpp

The single C++ source file used is:

Algorithm 99 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_clang_cpp11\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
All the file does is to create an empty graph, from the Boost.Graph library. It will not compile without the Boost libraries absent.

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 100 travis_qmake_clang_cpp11.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_clang_cpp11\travis_qmake_clang_cpp11.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The Qt Creator project file has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.

The bash build script to build and run this:

Algorithm 101 build.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_clang_cpp11\build.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The bash script has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 102 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_clang_cpp11\.travis.yml"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This .travis.yml file has ...

## C++11 and gcov

In this example, the C++98 build with gcov (chapter 4.7) is extended by using C++11.

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 103 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_gcov\.travis.yml"
```
```
sudo: require
language: cpp
compiler: gcc
before_install:
# C++11
- sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
- sudo apt-get update -qq
# Codecov
- sudo pip install codecov
install:
# C++11
- sudo apt-get install -qq g++-5
# Codecov
- sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-5 90
script:
- ./build.sh
- ./travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_gcov
# Codecov
- ./get_code_cov.sh
- codecov
after_success:
# Codecov
- bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)
```

This .travis.yml file has some new features:
‚Ä¢ sudo update‚àíalternatives ‚àí‚àíinstall /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov‚àí5 90
Codecov will call 'gcov', even if it should call 'gcov-5'. With this line, we let the command 'gcov' call 'gcov-5'

We must run the executable for codecov to be able to do its job.

### The build bash scripts

The bash build script to build this is trivial:

Algorithm 104 build.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_gcov\build.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The bash script to obtain the code coverage is new:

Algorithm 105 get_code_cov.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_gcov\get_code_cov.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The new steps are:
‚Ä¢ for filename in ` find . | egrep '\.cpp ' `;
do
gcov‚àí5 ‚àín ‚àío . $filename > /dev/null ;
done

Find all filenames (in this folder and its subfolder) that end with '.cpp'. For each of these filenames, let gcov-5 work on it. The '-n' flag denotes 'no output please'. Because there is still output, this output is sent to the void of '/dev/null'. The '-o .' means that the object files are in the same folder as this script

### The Qt Creator project files

This Qt Creator project file is a mix from using only gcov (chapter 4.7) and using C++11 (chapter 5.5)

Algorithm 106 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_gcov.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_gcov\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_gcov.pro"
```
```
SOURCES += main.cpp
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -Werror
# gcov
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage
LIBS += -lgcov
# C++11
QMAKE_CXX = g++-5
QMAKE_LINK = g++-5
QMAKE_CC = gcc-5
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++11
```

See those chapters for more details.

### The source files

The C++ source file used:

Algorithm 107 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_gcov\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
In this code, the function 'do_magic' is used for a single value, that is displayed on screen. Because the value '42' is not used, not all program flows of 'do_magic' are covered. The code coverage report should inform us about this.

## C++11 and Qt

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by both adding C++11 and the Qt library.

Specifications
‚Ä¢ Build system: qmake
‚Ä¢ C++ compiler: gcc
‚Ä¢ C++ version: C++11

# Thanks to Qt
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -Wno-unused-variable
```

The Qt Creator project file has the same lines as the basic project in chapter 3.

The bash build script to build this, run this and measure the code coverage:

Algorithm 110 build.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_qt\build.sh"

## C++11 and Rcpp

In this example, the basic build (chapter 3) is extended by also using the Rcpp library/package.

Specifications The chapter has the following specs:
‚Ä¢ Build system: qmake
‚Ä¢ C++ compiler: gcc
‚Ä¢ C++ version: C++11
‚Ä¢ Libraries: STL and Rcpp
‚Ä¢ Code coverage: none
‚Ä¢ Source: multiple files

### C++ and R: the C++ function

This Travis CI project is centered around the function 'do_magic_cpp'. I use the extension '_cpp' to indicate it is a C++ function. The function 'do_magic_cpp' is used by both C++ and R. It is declared in the header file 'do_magic_cpp.h', as shown here:

Algorithm 112 src/do_magic_cpp.h
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\src\do_magic_cpp.h"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The header file consists solely of #include guards and the declaration of the function 'do_magic_cpp'. The C++11 keyword 'noexcept' will make the build fail to compile under C++98, but will compile under C++11 and later versions of C++.

The function 'do_magic_cpp' is implemented in the implementation file 'do_magic_cpp.cpp', as shown here:

Algorithm 113 src/do_magic_cpp.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\src\do_magic_cpp.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This source file is very simple. Most lines are dedicates to the C++ roxygen2 documentation. Omitting this documentation will fail the R package to build, as this documentation is mandatory . Note that // [ [ Rcpp : : export ] ] needs to written exactly as such.

### C++: main source file

The C++ program has a normal main function:

Algorithm 114 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
All it does is a simple test of the 'do_magic_cpp' function.

### C++: Qt Creator project file

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 115 domagic.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\domagic.pro"
```
```
TEMPLATE = app
CONFIG += console
CONFIG -= app_bundle
CONFIG -= qt
# C++11
QMAKE_CXX = g++-5
QMAKE_LINK = g++-5
QMAKE_CC = gcc-5
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++11
# Shared C++11 files

# Rcpp does not play nice with -Weffc++
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Werror
# C++11-only files
SOURCES += main.cpp
# R
LIBS += -lR
```

Here is what the sections do:
‚Ä¢ # Shared C++11 f i l e s
INCLUDEPATH += src
SOURCES += src/do_magic_cpp. cpp
HEADERS += src/do_magic_cpp.h
These files are shared by the C++11 and R project
‚Ä¢ # Rcpp, adapted from script from Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois
R_HOME = $$system(R RHOME)
RCPPINCL = $$system($$R_HOME/bin/Rscript ‚àíe \"Rcpp : : : CxxFlags \(\)\")
INCLUDEPATH += RCPPINCL
‚Ä¢ # Rcpp does not play nice with ‚àíWeffc++
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += ‚àíWall ‚àíWextra ‚àíWerror
Let Rcpp be found by and compile cleanly. To do so, the '-We?c++' warnings have to be omitted
‚Ä¢ # C++11‚àíonly f i l e s
SOURCES += main . cpp
This contains the main function that is only used by the C++11-only build
‚Ä¢ # R
LIBS += ‚àílR

5.8.4 C++: build script
The C++ bash build script is straightforward.

Algorithm 116 build_cpp.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\build_cpp.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This script is already described in the C++98 and Rcpp chapter (chapter 4.14, Algorithm 43).

### R: the R function

The R function 'do_magic_r' calls the C++ function 'do_magic_cpp':

Algorithm 117 R/do_magic_r.R
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\R\do_magic_r.R"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Must lines are dedicated to Roxygen2 documentation. Omitting this documentation will fail the R package to build, as this documentation is mandatory.

### R: The R tests

R allows for easy testing using the 'testthat' package. A test file looks as such:

Algorithm 118 tests/testthat/test-do_magic_r.R
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\tests\testthat\test-do_magic.R"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The tests call both the R and C++ functions with certain inputs and checks if the output matches the expectations. It may be a good idea to only call the R function from here, and move the C++ function tests to a C++ testing suite like Boost.Test.

### R: script to install packages

Algorithm 119 install_r_packages.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\install_r_packages.R"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
To compile the C++ code, Rcpp needs to be installed. The R package needs the other packages to work. An R code repository from the UK was used: without supply an R code repository, Travis will be asked to pick one, which it cannot.

### The Travis script

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 120 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp\.travis.yml"
```
```
sudo: true

after_failure:
- cat /home/travis/build/richelbilderbeek/travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_rcpp/..Rcheck/00check.log
```

This .travis.yml file is rather extensive:
‚Ä¢ sudo : true
language : cpp
compiler : gcc
The default language used has to be C++
‚Ä¢ before_install :
‚àí sudo add‚àíapt‚àírepository ‚àíy ppa : ubuntu‚àítoolchain‚àír/ test # C++11
‚àí sudo add‚àíapt‚àírepository ‚àíy ppa : marutter/ rrutter # R
‚àí sudo apt‚àíget update ‚àíqq
Before installation, Travis has to add to apt repositories, one for C++11
and one for the R version used by CRAN
‚Ä¢ install :
‚àí sudo apt‚àíget install ‚àíqq g++‚àí5 # C++11
‚àí sudo apt‚àíget install ‚àíqq r‚àíbase r‚àíbase‚àídev # R
‚àí sudo apt‚àíget install ‚àíqq lyx texlive # pdflatex , used by knitr
‚àí sudo Rscript install_r_packages .R # Rcpp
Travis has to install the prerequisites for C++11, R, pd?atex (used by R's
knitr) and some R packages
‚Ä¢ script :
# C++
‚àí ./ build_cpp . sh
# R wants all non‚àíR f i l e s gone . . .
‚àí ./ clean . sh
‚àí rm . gitignore
‚àí rm src /. gitignore
‚àí rm . travis . yml
‚àí rm ‚àírf . git
‚àí rm ‚àírf . . Rcheck
# Now R is ready to go
‚àí R CMD check .
The script consists out of a build and run of the C++11 code, cleaning
up for R, then building an R package

## C++14 and Boost.Test

This project consists out of two projects:

‚Ä¢ travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test.pro: the real code
‚Ä¢ travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test_test.pro: the tests

Both projects center around a function called 'add', which is located in the 'my_function.h' and 'my_function.cpp' files, as shown here:

```
travis_qmake
_gcc_cpp14
_boost_test.pro
main.cpp my_function.h
my_function.cpp
travis_qmake
_gcc_cpp14
_boost.pro
main_test.cpp
my_function_test.cpp
```

![Tag](image.png "Description"){: style="height=150px"}

Figure 32: Venn diagram of the files uses in this build

Both of these are compiled both in release and debug mode.

Specifics The basic build has the following specs:

‚Ä¢ Build system: qmake
‚Ä¢ C++ compiler: gcc
‚Ä¢ C++ version: C++14
‚Ä¢ Libraries: STL and Boost, demonstrating Boost.Test
‚Ä¢ Code coverage: none
‚Ä¢ Source: multiple files: main.cpp, my_function.h, my_function.cpp, test_my_function.cpp

5.13.1 The function

First the function that is (1) tested by the test build (2) called by the real build, is shown here:

Algorithm 135 my_function.h
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test\my_functions.h"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This header file has the #include guards and the declaration of the function 'add'. It takes two integer values as an argument and returns an int.

Its definition is shown here:

Algorithm 136 my_function.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test\my_functions.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Perhaps it was expected that 'add' adds the two integers

### Test build

The test build' is the build that tests the function. It does not have a 'main.cpp' as the exe build has, but uses 'test_my_functions.cpp' as its main source file.

This can be seen in the Qt Creator project file:


Algorithm 137 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test_test.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test_test.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Note how this Qt Creator project file links to the Boost unit test framework.

Its main source file is shown here:

Algorithm 138 main_test.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test\main_test.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
It uses the Boost.Test framework to automatically generate a main function and test suite. An empty file is created, so Travis can verify there has been built both a debug and release mode.

Its main testing file file is shown here:

Algorithm 139 my_functions_test.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test\my_functions_test.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
It tests the function 'add'.

### Exe build

The 'exe' build' is the build that uses the function.

Algorithm 140 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Next to using the function 'add', also a file is created, so Travis can verify there has been built both a debug and release mode.

This single file is compiled with qmake from the following Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 141 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp14_boost_test.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Note how this Qt Creator project file does not link to the Boost unit test framework.

# Extending the build by multiple steps

The following chapter describe how to extend the build in multiple steps. These are:

‚Ä¢ Use of C++11, Boost.Test and gcov: see chapter

## C++11 and use of gcov in debug mode only

In this example, the C++11 build with gcov in debug mode (chapter ???) is extended by using C++11.

### Build overview

This will be a more complex build, consisting of two projects:

‚Ä¢ The regular project that just runs the code
‚Ä¢ The project that measures code coverage

The filenames are shown in this Figure:

travis_qmake
```
_gcc_cpp11
_gcov.pro
main.cpp
do_magic.h
do_magic.cpp
travis_qmake
_gcc_cpp11
_gcov_gcov.pro
main_gcov.cpp
```

### The Travis file

Setting up Travis is done by the following .travis.yml:

Algorithm 143 .travis.yml
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov\.travis.yml"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
This .travis.yml file has some new features:
‚Ä¢ sudo : true
Travis will give super user rights to the script. This will slow the build time, but it is inevitable for the next step
‚Ä¢ before_install : sudo pip install codecov
Travis will use pip to install codecov using super user rights
‚Ä¢ after_success : codecov
After the script has run successfully, codecov is called

### The Qt Creator project files

Release:

Algorithm 144 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Debug with gcov:

Algorithm 145 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_gcov.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov_gcov.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
The Qt Creator project file has two new lines:
‚Ä¢ QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += ‚àífprofile ‚àíarcs ‚àíftest ‚àícoverage
Let the C++ compiler add coverage information
‚Ä¢ LIBS += ‚àílgcov
Link against the gcov library

### The source files

Common files Both builds use the following code:

Algorithm 146 do_magic.h
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov\do_magic.h"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
And its implementation:

Algorithm 147 do_magic.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov\do_magic.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Release main function The C++ source file used by the normal build is:

Algorithm 148 main.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov\main.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Debug and gcov main function The C++ source file used by the normal build is:

Algorithm 149 main_gcov.cpp
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_debug_gcov\main_gcov.cpp"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)

## C++11, Boost.Test and gcov

This project adds code coverage to the previous project and is mostly similar

This project consists out of two projects:
‚Ä¢ travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test_gcov.pro: the real code
‚Ä¢ travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test_gcov_test.pro: the tests, also measures the code coverage

Both projects center around a function called 'add', which is located in the 'my_function.h' and 'my_function.cpp' files, as shown here:

travis_qmake
```
_gcc_cpp11
_boost_test
_gcov.pro
main.cpp my_function.h
my_function.cpp
travis_qmake
_gcc_cpp11

Both of these are compiled both in release and debug mode.

### The function

Same

### Test build

The test build' is the build that tests the function. It does not have a 'main.cpp' as the exe build has, but uses 'test_my_functions.cpp' as its main source file.

This can be seen in the Qt Creator project file:

Algorithm 150 travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test_gcov_test.pro
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test_gcov\travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test_gcov_test.pro"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
Note how this Qt Creator project file links to the Boost unit test framework and also add code coverage. Its main source file is identical. Its main testing file file is identical.

### Normal build

The normal build is identical.

### Build script

The bash build script to build, test and run this:

Algorithm 151 build_test.sh
```
--8<-- "travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_boost_test_gcov\build_test.sh"
```

[//]: # (Algorithm matched to file)
In this script both projects are compiled in both debug and release mode. All four executables are run.

# Troubleshooting

## sudo apt-get install gcov-5 failed and exited with during .

Or in full:

The command `sudo ‚àíE apt‚àíget ‚àíyq ‚àí‚àíno‚àíinstall ‚àísuggests ‚àí‚àíno‚àíinstall ‚àírecommends ‚àí‚àíforce‚àíyes install gcov‚àí5` failed and exited with 100 during .

It means Travis-CI cannot find the package 'gcov-5' in the 'addons' section.

Comment out the addons section and add this to the Travis script:

`apt‚àícache search "gcov" | egrep "^gcov"`
One can then observe that 'gcov' is absent. It is part of g++.

## Cannot find the correct version of a package

Comment out the addons section and add this to the Travis script:

```
‚àí apt‚àícache search "g++" | egrep "^gcc"
‚àí apt‚àícache search "g++" | egrep "^g\+\+"
‚àí apt‚àícache search "gcov" | egrep "^gcov"
‚àí apt‚àícache search "libboost "| egrep "^libboost"
```

This will cause Travis to search the aptitude packages.

## fatal error: Rcpp.h: No such file or directory

Add these line to the .travis.yml file to ?nd Rcpp.h:

```
after_failure :
# fatal error : Rcpp.h: No such f i l e or directory
‚àí find / ‚àíname 'Rcpp.h'
```

You can then add the folder found to the INCLUDEPATHS of the Qt Create project file.
